Advent of Code 2022 ðŸŽ„

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 puzzles â€” a series of daily programming challenges released every December.

The goal is to practice problem-solving, improve coding skills, and have some fun along the way. Each day includes two related problems that gradually increase in complexity. I aim for clean, readable, and efficient solutions.
